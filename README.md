# Movie Search App

I developed this app using **ReactJS** which allows the user to search for a movie by entering a movie name (any text) in the text box. It makes a fetch call to the OMDB API *(http://www.omdbapi.com)* searching for all the movie names that include/mactches with the text enetered, and loads the MovieApp React component with first 10 movies showing their poster (if available), title and year of release. I have styled it using Bootstrap 4.
